# Brainstorming

I don't even know where to start.

There is a max of 8 possible moves for the knight at any given time.

Since this is similar (but not identical) to a binary tree, I assume the setup would involve the current placement of the knight being the root and all possible moves being a child node.

This could be a recursive method to traverse the tree until the desired vertex is found.

I don't think I'd want to do depth first since any given path could go on a lot longer than the actual shortest path. Doing a breadth first traversal might be better. I have no idea.
